            <h2>
                More than one in four of the 50 largest venture-backed companies to go public since 2019 made assertions about 
                their profitability that don’t appear to line up with their later IPO-related disclosures to the SEC, a new 
                Forbes analysis has found.
            </h2>
                <p><span class="A">A</span> llBirds burst onto the fashion scene five years ago with its wool fabric shoes 
                    and proclamations of being environmentally conscious. It quickly won fans in Silicon Valley too, raising 
                    $200 million from venture investors. </p>
                <p>
                    Along the way, much of the hype went beyond the trendy shoes, centering on Allbirds’ financial success. 
                    By CEO Joey Zwillinger’s account, the company had been “profitable since basically day one” — a remark he made to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trendy-sneaker-startup-allbirds-laces-up-1-4-billion-valuation-1539281112" target="_blank"> Wall Street Journal</a> 
                    in 2018. Two years later, he reinforced the message, telling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/allbirds-ceo-joey-zwillinger-on-the-startups-100-million-round-profitability-and-spac-mania/" 
                    target="_blank"> TechCrunch</a>, “We’ve been profitable for most of our existence.” </p>
                <p>
                    But when the company filed to go public last month, Zwillinger’s assertions were at odds with disclosures 
                    made by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact, the company stated in a 
                    <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653909/000162828021017824/allbirdss-1.htm" target="_blank"> filing </a> 
                    ahead of its planned IPO that it had “incurred significant net losses since inception and anticipate that 
                    we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.” AllBirds declined to comment on the record because it is in a quiet period. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    AllBirds is one of numerous startups whose executives got ahead of themselves as they ramped up to go 
                    public, according to a Forbes analysis. Leaders of the companies, including Palantir, Lyft, Oscar Health 
                    and others, made oral and written claims about profitability in the media or at public events that didn’t 
                    sync up with later company filings to the SEC, known as S-1 or F-1 documents. In all, executives at more 
                    than one in four of the 50 biggest companies to go public since January 2019 appear to have made such statements, Forbes found.

                    “It’s enthusiastic entrepreneurs...who have such faith in themselves and what they've created that they 
                    find it hard to switch off that mode when you're talking about factual things like profitability,” says Suraj 
                    Srinivasan, an accounting and management professor at Harvard Business School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Softbank-backed VTEX, an online store builder for enterprise companies that went public in 
                    July and is now valued at over $4 billion, disclosed in its F-1 filed in June that it had incorrectly 
                    stated in 2020 that it had been profitable in that year. In fact, it had lost $800,000, and its profit 
                    claims, it said, could prompt lawsuits against the company. “Before the IPO, VTEX did not report its financials 
                    in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards,” the company said in a statement to 
                    Forbes, “therefore, the way management viewed the company’s profitability at that time was from a perspective 
                    of cash provided by operating activities, not in a technical term but in a broader sense."

                    AllBirds cofounder, New Zealand native Joey Zwillinger, made claims about the profitability of his popular

                    Other companies said that, when their executives spoke of profitability in broad and optimistic terms in 
                    the years before their IPOs, they were relying on alternative profitability metrics such as “adjusted EBITDA” 
                    or “structural profitability.” A spokesperson for Peloton, for instance, whose CEO 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAdp0R8B_rU" target="_blank"> said </a> the company was profitable 
                    while it was private before the company stated otherwise in an 
                    <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000119312519230923/d738839ds1.htm" target="_blank"> 
                    IPO-related filing </a> to the SEC, explained the discrepancy this way: "We were obviously a private 
                    company in 2018 and internal company definitions of profitability often differ from [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles].”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm" 
                    target="_blank"> documents filed </a> with the SEC ahead of its April IPO, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase 
                    disclosed that it generated a net loss of $30 million in 2019—a fact that seemed to contradict comments made 
                    by CEO Brian Armstrong at an event hosted by 
                    <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/brian-armstrong-confirms-coinbase-is-profitable" target="_blank"> 
                        Vanity Fair </a> in October 2019 in which he said the company was profitable that year and in the two prior years. 
                        In a statement to Forbes, a Coinbase spokesperson said that “during 2019, we were profitable on an adjusted 
                        EBITDA basis.” The spokesperson added that Coinbase was using an accounting practice that calculated its digital 
                        assets at fair value at the time of Armstrong’s comment, and that when it prepared for its IPO, it calculated 
                        those assets at cost, which swung the company into the red. The Vanity Fair article did not mention the type 
                        of accounting practice to which the company refers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such discrepancies rarely impact the companies going forward. That is especially true with Coinbase, 
                    which posted a profit of $322 million in 2020, before it went public in April, and 
                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2021/08/10/despite-bitcoin-drop-coinbase-net-profit-doubles-as-trading-volume-swells/?sh=7bb24dd379ca" target="_blank"> reported </a> an astonishing $1.6 billion net profit in the second quarter of this year. 
                    It now has a market cap of $50 billion.

                <p>
                    But that’s not always the case. Concerns about exaggerated profitability helped contribute to the collapse 
                    of WeWork’s IPO in 2019. For years, the coworking company and its CEO Adam Neumann spun rosy stories of vast 
                    market potential, and invented new profit metrics such as “Community-Adjusted EBITDA.” Based in part on 
                    these claims, WeWork’s thousands of employees <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/04/13/wework-employees-feel-abandoned-and-angry-as-softbank-ditches-its-3-billion-buyout-offer/?sh=587715dd1320" 
                    target="_blank"> took equity in exchange </a> for lower salaries, in the hope of cashing out when the company 
                    went public. But things began to unravel ahead of its IPO in part because WeWork’s true financial position 
                    disclosed to the SEC ran counter to earlier claims made by executives to journalists that the company was profitable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 2019, WeWork withdrew its IPO plans, its valuation plummeted, and most employees' shares became worthless. 
                    “WeWork will become a public company, but we can only IPO once, and we want to do it right,” former WeWork 
                    executives Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said in a statement at the time. In March, the company announced 
                    renewed plans to go public through a SPAC deal at less than 20% of its 2019 valuation.

                    “Employees are the ones who I worry about most,” says Tripp Jones, a partner at Uncork Capital, who has served on 
                    more than a dozen company boards. “Because they will join companies based on statements around profitability.”

                    Some companies have suggested profitability was closer than it turned out to be. Buzzy health insurance 
                    firm Oscar, co-founded by Josh Kushner and backed by Alphabet, drummed up enthusiasm for its financial 
                    performance in 2018 when CFO Brian West told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/oscar-health-raises-165-million-at-3-point-2-billion-alphabet-founders.html" target="_blank"> CNBC </a>: “Before you know it, we’ll be profitable...it’s around the corner.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that appears to have been wishful thinking. When Oscar filed to go public in March, it 
                    <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521030955/d28906ds1.htm" target="_blank"> disclosed </a> 
                    that its losses grew from $261 million in 2019 to $407 million in 2020. “The comment made by Brian West was 
                    regarding gross margin related to the ratio of premiums to medical claims for our insurance business, which 
                    we refer to as our Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR,” an Oscar spokesperson said in an email to Forbes. “This is a 
                    common metric provided by healthcare insurance companies.”

                    At times, investors have added to the overly cheerful narrative. Navin Chaddha, an investor in Poshmark, 
                    told <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/poshmark-unicorn-ceo-manish-chandra-interview" target="_blank"> Vogue Business </a> 
                    in a 2019 company profile that the used-fashion marketplace was “a very well-run company from a cash-flow perspective...
                    Most people lose tons of money. And we don't.” But Poshmark’s S-1 showed the company’s losses more than tripled to 
                    $49 million that year. Poshmark declined to comment. Chaddha did not respond to a request for comment.

                    The SEC has the power to sue and fine privately held companies and their executives if they make false claims 
                    directly to investors. But the agency rarely takes action when corporate leaders exaggerate their profitability 
                    in media interviews or public appearances because such claims are so widespread—and because the agency doesn’t 
                    have the resources to police every statement a CEO makes to a news outlet, says David Chase, a former SEC attorney 
                    who now defends clients in SEC cases that often involve scrutiny of public statements. The SEC did not respond 
                    to a request for comment. “That recipe of not being perhaps guided by experienced securities transactional counsel, 
                    coupled with companies that are desperate for capital, you get these statements that oftentimes veer from the truth,” Chase says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agency is most likely to take action if executives make false statements in financial filings, which are 
                    intended to be the legal statement of record for investors. Last month, for instance, Manish Lachwani, a co-founder 
                    and former CEO of mobile-app testing startup Headspin, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/co-founder-and-former-ceo-palo-alto-based-start-technology-company-headspin-charged" target="_blank"> charged </a> 
                    by the Justice Department with wire fraud and securities fraud. The SEC filed an accompanying civil complaint. 
                    The criminal complaint says that an independent accounting firm found that the company had overstated its revenue 
                    by more than $50 million and made false claims about profitability while raising money from investors including 
                    Tiger Global Management and Dell Technologies Capital. Lachwani is facing up to 20 years in prison and penalties 
                    up to $5 million. He has pleaded not guilty to the Justice Department charges; his response to the SEC is pending. 
                    “There are terabytes of additional data that will show that Mr. Lachwani never concealed the true financial 
                    condition of the company from its private investors,” John Hemann, an attorney representing Lachwani, said in a statement. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, executives continue to cheer on their companies in the years before announcing their intentions 
                    to go public, often using whatever profitability metric will make the company look the best. “Many CEOs 
                    [of private companies] will colloquially talk about profitability for what in their mind, they've been trained to 
                    care about, which is free cash flow,” says Tom Loverro, an investor at venture capital firm IVP. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warby Parker said in 2018 that it would be profitable that year, news that was covered by several publications. 
                    While <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/warby-parker-raises-another-75-million-declares-profitability-on-road-to-ipo" 
                    target="_blank"> The Business of Fashion </a> reported that the eyewear company would be profitable on an EBITDA 
                    basis, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/business/dealbook/warby-parker-fundraising.html" 
                    target="_blank"> New York Times </a> reported that it would be “the retailer’s first full year of turning a profit,” 
                    citing co-CEO Dave Gilboa. But when it filed to go public last month, Warby Parker 
                    <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504776/000162828021017546/warbyparkerincs-1.htm" target="_blank"> disclosed </a> 
                    that it had “a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability” and made no mention of 
                    delivering a profit. It posted a $56 million net loss in 2020. Warby Parker declined to comment as it is in a quiet period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For both Warby Parker and AllBirds, like others before them, their profit statements are unlikely to affect 
                    their bottom lines, or their stocks’ performances: after all, their glasses and shoes, respectively, are 
                    popular among consumers. “If the company still goes public and makes money for everybody, no one will 
                    care,” says Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “There’s no consequences.”

                    made rosy claims about profitability. Their IPO-related filings to the SEC told a different story.

                        <strong> Company Response:</strong> "During 2019, we were profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis." 
                        Coinbase added that it was using an accounting practice that calculated its digital assets at fair 
                        value, and that when it prepared for its IPO, it calculated those assets at cost, which swung the company into the red.
